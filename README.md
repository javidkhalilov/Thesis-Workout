The primary factor that restricts the new control systems developments for air vehicles and the implementation of various sensors for advanced algorithms is the deficiency of quick and cost-effective physical environment. Flight tests are costly and requires a long preparation process. The aim of this thesis is to improve the simulator infrastructure which easily implementable to the AscTec Hummingbird Quadrotor that is located in the University’s lab and have interaction with the 3D physical environment. Firstly, quadrotor’s mathematical model has been developed and this model is implemented on Matlab/Simulink environment. Afterwards, a basic PID controller is developed for attitude control. The quadrotor’s physical model, the electric motor, the rotor and the IMU model have been modelled on Virtual Robotics Experimentation Platform (V-REP). Matlab / Simulink controller is synchronized with the V-REP and is used for the quadrotor’s physical environment tests. The verification of the simulation is done by real experimental flight data of AscTec Hummingbird. The collision avoidance and wall following algorithms in empty room using ultrasonic distance sensors are implemented to show the usefulness of simulator infrastructure.
